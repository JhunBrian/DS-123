    "### What is Data Structure?\n",
    "\n",
    "Data structures refer to the organization, management, and storage of data in a computer system or program. The term \"data\" refers to the raw facts and figures that are input, processed, and output by a computer system, while \"structure\" refers to the arrangement or format in which these data are organized and stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, data structures provide a systematic way to organize and manipulate data efficiently, allowing for easy access, modification, and retrieval. They are fundamental components of computer science and programming, essential for optimizing algorithms and improving the performance of software systems."

    "<!-- It all boils down on our data generation, we can see that we are generating data exponentially, and a forecast by forbes shows that by the year 2025, we'll be having 175 zetabytes of data in our data sphere \n",
    "\n",
    "The term \"datasphere\" has been used to broadly define digital space and information, particularly in relation to information flow, data, and digital platforms. Since the 1980s, the concept started to be used more and more.\n",

    "As applications are getting complex and data-rich, there are three common problems that applications face nowadays.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data search:**  Consider an inventory of 1 million items of a store. If the application is to search an item, it has to search an item in 1 million items every time slowing down the search. As data grows, the search will become slower.\n",
    "- **Processor speed:** Processor speed although being very high, falls limited if the data grows to billion records.\n",
    "- **Multiple requests:** As thousands of users can search data simultaneously on a web server, even the fast server fails while searching the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve the above-mentioned problems, data structures come to the rescue. \n",
    "\n",
    "Data can be organized in a data structure in such a way that the required data to be searched can be found almost instantly without the need to go through all the items one by one."

    "\n",
    "Big O notation is a mathematical notation used in computer science to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm in terms of the size of the input (often denoted as $n$). It provides an upper bound on the growth rate of an algorithm, allowing you to analyze and compare the efficiency of algorithms.\n",

    "**Key Aspects of Big O Notation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Growth Rate**: It measures how the runtime or space requirements of an algorithm grow as the input size increases.\n",
    "2. **Worst-Case Analysis**: Big O notation typically focuses on the worst-case scenario, ensuring that the algorithm performs adequately even in the most demanding situations.\n"
